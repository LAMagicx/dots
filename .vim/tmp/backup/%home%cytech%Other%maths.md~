## Theorem 2

This curve is uniquely defined by z.

Denote by $F(y) = \int_{y_z} f(z) dz$

We will prove that $F(z)$ is a primative for $f(z)$ on $D$.

Let $z_0 \in D$, $h \in C$ such that $z_0 + h \in D$

$$
\begin{align*}
F(z_0 + h) - F(y) &= \int_{y_{z_0 + h}} f - \int_{y_{z_0}} f\\
&= \int_{y_{z_0 + h}} f + \int_{y_{z_0}^{-}} f
\end{align*}
$$

Define $\sigma$, $C$, $R$ and $T$ as in the figure. Then

$$
\int_C + \int_{\sigma} = \int_R + \int_T = 0
$$

This implies
